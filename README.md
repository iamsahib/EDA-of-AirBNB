# Airbnb Data Analysis

## Objective
The objective of this project is to analyze Airbnb listing data to gain insights into pricing trends, availability, and key factors influencing rental prices. The project involves data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and feature engineering to enhance predictive capabilities.

## Goal
- Clean and preprocess Airbnb dataset  
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)  
- Identify trends and patterns in pricing, availability, and geographical distribution  
- Engineer new features for better insights and predictive modeling  

## Libraries Used
- **pandas** - Data manipulation and preprocessing  
- **numpy** - Numerical computations  
- **matplotlib & seaborn** - Data visualization  
- **scikit-learn (sklearn)** - Machine learning models and preprocessing  

## Features Added
### Data Cleaning
- Removed missing values and duplicate entries  
- Converted data types for better processing  

### Feature Engineering
- Created a new column to categorize price ranges  
- Extracted temporal and geographical insights  

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Univariate and bivariate analysis  
- Price distribution analysis using histograms and boxplots  
- Outlier detection and treatment  
- Geographical visualization of listings  

## Recommendations
- Further analyze seasonality trends to optimize pricing strategies  
- Consider additional location-based features for price prediction  
- Use machine learning models to predict listing prices based on features  
- Conduct sentiment analysis on reviews for deeper insights  

## Conclusion
This analysis provides valuable insights into Airbnb pricing patterns and availability. Future improvements can include machine learning models for price prediction and deeper sentiment analysis to understand guest preferences.
